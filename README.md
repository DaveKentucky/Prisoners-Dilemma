# Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma

This project is my python implementation of the genetic algorithm focused on finding the best strategy for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. 

### Theory

Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is a problem of the game theory that covers multiple rounds of prisoner's dilemma choices betwween two players. The game has a large evolutionary algorithm potential, which was discovered and investigated originally by Robert Axelrod, who tried to define the most succcesfull strategies for the game. In this project the approach is similair to Axelrod's one, as it takes several very succesful strategies, and crosses them with random ones trying to develop even better combinations of moves as the simulation follows.

### Implementation

My implementation was made with python supported by DEAP library as the main tool. User can try to develop their best strategy with simply simulating totally random original strategies or face them with group of commonly known strategies with good performance.
